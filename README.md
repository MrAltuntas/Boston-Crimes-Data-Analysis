# Boston-Crimes-Data-Analysis
This repository about Boston Crimes Data Analysis. I used Folium map, Geo plotting, Seaborn and other stuff you may want to see it.

# Folium map is not looking on the github but you can see the map on the kaggle :))

Actually I made this notebook on kaggle and I just loaded in here.

You can reach this notebook by the link:https://www.kaggle.com/altuntas/boston-crimes-eda-folium-geo-plotting-with-explan
